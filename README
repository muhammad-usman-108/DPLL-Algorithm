### Introduction 
Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.

### Pre-requisites
Before starting, make sure you have installed the node.js, otherwise you can installed from official site of Node.js

### Setting up
Implement a SAT solver for propositional logic following the DPLL architecture.
You have to implement a trail, boolean constraint propagation, decisions, backtracking as presented
for DPLL.
