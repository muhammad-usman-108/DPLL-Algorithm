### Introduction 



### React 
In logic and computer science, the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form, i.e. for solving the CNF-SAT problem.

### ECharts 
is a powerful library of JavaScript for visualization, based on zrender offering an easy way of adding intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts.


### Pre-requisites
Before starting, make sure you have installed the node.js, otherwise you can installed from official site of Node.js

### Setting up
Implement a SAT solver for propositional logic following the DPLL architecture.
You have to implement a trail, boolean constraint propagation, decisions, backtracking as presented
for DPLL.
